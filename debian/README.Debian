ipset for Debian
----------------

ipset(8) is a control utility for the ipset kernel modules from the
netfilter patch-o-matic project.

The patch-o-matic release corresponding to this release of ipset can be
downloaded here:

    http://ipset.netfilter.org/install.html

Alternatively, the netfilter-extensions-source Debian package can be
used to build the ipset kernel modules out-of-tree.
