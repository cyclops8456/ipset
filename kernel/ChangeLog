3.0
  - New kernel-userspace protocol release
  - Bigendian and 64/32bit fixes (Stefan Gula, bugzilla id 593)
  - Support of 2.4.3[67].*  kernels fixed
  - Compiling with debugging enabled fixed

2.5.0
  - Use the spinlock initiator instead of setting the locks directly
    as it causes compilation errors with 2.6.29-rt (Jan Engelhardt).
2.4.9
  - References to the old include file replaced with new one in order to
    really use the new Jenkins' hash function.

2.4.8
  - The Jenkins' hash lookup2() replaced with Jenkins' faster/better lookup3()
    hash function.
  - Bug fixed: after elements are added and deleted from a hash, an element
    can successfully be added in spite it's already in the hash and thus
    duplicates can occur (Shih-Yi Chen). 
  - Compatibility with old gcc without 'bool' added.

2.4.7
  - Typo which broke compilation with kernels < 2.6.28
    fixed (reported by Richard Lucassen, Danny Rawlins)

2.4.6
  - Compatibility fix for kernels >= 2.6.28

2.4.5
  - setlist type does not work properly together with swapping
    sets, bug reported by Thomas Jacob.
  - Include linux/capability.h explicitly in ip_set.c (Jan Engelhardt)

2.4.4
  - Premature checking prevents to add valid elements to hash
    types, fixed (bug reported by JC Janos).

2.4.2
  - When flushing a nethash/ipportnethash type of set, it can
    lead to a kernel crash due to a wrong type declaration,
    bug reported by Krzysztof Oledzki.
  - iptree and iptreemap types require the header file linux/timer.h,
    also reported by Krzysztof Oledzki.
  
2.4.1
  - Zero-valued element are not accepted by hash type of sets
    because we cannot make a difference between a zero-valued
    element and not-set element.
2.4
  - ipportiphash, ipportnethash and setlist types added
  - set type modules reworked to avoid code duplication
    as much as possible, code unification macros 
  - expand_macros Makefile target added to help debugging
    code unification macros
  - ip_set_addip_kernel and ip_set_delip_kernel
    changed from void to int, __ip_set_get_byname and
    __ip_set_put_byid added for the sake of setlist type
  - unnecessary includes removed
  - compatibility fix for kernels >= 2.6.27:
    semaphore.h was moved from asm/ to linux/ (James King)
  - ChangeLog forked for kernel part
