5.0
 - New main branch - ipset completely rewritten

4.4
  - The ipporthash, ipportiphash and ipportnethash set types did not
    work with mixed "src" and "dst" destination parameters of the
    "set" and "SET" iptables match and target (reported by Dash Four)
  - Errorneous semaphore handling in error path fixed
    (reported by Jan Engelhardt, bugzilla id 668)

4.3
  - Kernel 2.6.35 support added

4.2
  - nethash and ipportnethash types counted every entry twice
    which could produce bogus entries when listing/saving these types
    of sets (bug reported by Husnu Demir)

4.1
  - Do not use init_MUTEX either (Jan Engelhardt)
  - Improve listing/saving hash type of sets by not copying empty
    entries unnecessarily to userspace.

4.0
  - Compilation of ip_set_iptree.c fails with kernel 2.6.20 due to
    missing include of linux/jiffies.h (Jan Engelhardt)
  - Do not use DECLARE_MUTEX (compatibility fix on 2.6.31-rt, Jan
    Engelhardt)

    zeroed out gc parameter (bug reported by Georg Chini)

    (bug reported by Georg Chini)
  - Binding support is removed

3.2
  - Mixed up formats in ip_set_iptree.c (Rob Sterenborg)
  - Don't use 'bool' for backward compatibility reasons (Rob Sterenborg)

3.1
  - Nonexistent sets were reported as existing sets when testing
    from userspace in setlist type of sets (bug reported by Victor A.
    Safronov)
  - When saving sets, setlist type of sets must come last in order
    to satisfy the dependency from the elements (bug reported by Marty B.)
  - Sparse insists that the flags argument to kmalloc() is gfp_t
    (Stephen Hemminger)
  - Correct format specifiers and change %i to %d (Jan Engelhardt)

3.0
  - New kernel-userspace protocol release
  - Bigendian and 64/32bit fixes (Stefan Gula, bugzilla id 593)
  - Support of 2.4.3[67].*  kernels fixed
  - Compiling with debugging enabled fixed

2.5.0
  - Use the spinlock initiator instead of setting the locks directly
    as it causes compilation errors with 2.6.29-rt (Jan Engelhardt).
2.4.9
  - References to the old include file replaced with new one in order to
    really use the new Jenkins' hash function.

2.4.8
  - The Jenkins' hash lookup2() replaced with Jenkins' faster/better lookup3()
    hash function.
  - Bug fixed: after elements are added and deleted from a hash, an element
    can successfully be added in spite it's already in the hash and thus
    duplicates can occur (Shih-Yi Chen). 
  - Compatibility with old gcc without 'bool' added.

2.4.7
  - Typo which broke compilation with kernels < 2.6.28
    fixed (reported by Richard Lucassen, Danny Rawlins)

2.4.5
  - setlist type does not work properly together with swapping
    sets, bug reported by Thomas Jacob.
  - Include linux/capability.h explicitly in ip_set.c (Jan Engelhardt)

2.4.4
  - Premature checking prevents to add valid elements to hash
    types, fixed (bug reported by JC Janos).

2.4.2
  - When flushing a nethash/ipportnethash type of set, it can
    lead to a kernel crash due to a wrong type declaration,
    bug reported by Krzysztof Oledzki.
  - iptree and iptreemap types require the header file linux/timer.h,
    also reported by Krzysztof Oledzki.
  
2.4.1
  - Zero-valued element are not accepted by hash type of sets
    because we cannot make a difference between a zero-valued
    element and not-set element.
2.4
  - ipportiphash, ipportnethash and setlist types added
  - set type modules reworked to avoid code duplication
    as much as possible, code unification macros 
  - expand_macros Makefile target added to help debugging
    code unification macros
  - ip_set_addip_kernel and ip_set_delip_kernel
    changed from void to int, __ip_set_get_byname and
    __ip_set_put_byid added for the sake of setlist type

  - compatibility fix for kernels >= 2.6.27:
    semaphore.h was moved from asm/ to linux/ (James King)
  - ChangeLog forked for kernel part
